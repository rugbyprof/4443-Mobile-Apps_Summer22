## Overview

Using the "Flash Chat" completed project: https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Flash-Chat-Flutter-Complete as a template, create a location based food truck app that incorporates a google map plugin which will (at a minimum) show the location of each food truck. I will provide a json file with the basic information about each food truck, and a list of possible locations that the food trucks can reside. 

I mentioned that we would use **MongoDB** as a backend for this app, but we will continue with **FireBase** so that we can get this project done by Friday. 

### Screens

- Welcome
- Register
- Login
- Truck Locations


#### Welcom Screen

Create your own "splash" screen using something other than the "Flash Chat" images, animations, and color scheme. In addition you need to create your own **app icon** for this project. 

#### Register and Login Screens

Keep exactly the same layout if you like, just change the color scheme.

#### Truck Locations Screen
