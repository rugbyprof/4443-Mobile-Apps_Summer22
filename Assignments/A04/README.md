## Assignment  5 - Final Project Proposal
#### Due: 06-20-2022 (Monday @ 12:30 p.m.)

## Overview

- Determine what type of project you will write.
- It needs to include some minimum components:
  - User Registration and Login
  - Backend Api
  - Multiple Screens
  
- Other than that, I don't care what you do as long as it's somewhat challenging.
- You can use any of the code from the Udemy course to incorporate into your app, you just need to change it enough to make it slightly different. I'm talking about style mostly. If it's location or something similar, you can use Dr. Yu's models as long as you credit her in the comments. 

### Example Requirements Doc

The simplest requirements are written like below, using the three keywords: needs, wants, wishes.

- **Needs**: must have this ability or system will not be useful.
- **Wants**: would be very nice but not absolutely necessary right now.
- **Wishes**: self explanatory

- Requirements:
  - Bob needs the ability to login to the system.
  - Bob needs the ability to view inventory.
  - Bob needs the ability to search for a specific bike.
  - Bob wants the ability to filter a search (type of bike etc.). 
  - Bob wishes for the ability to predict future sales.
  - Bob wants different levels of users.

The requirements can be further broken down later into more specifics. Like what does "different levels of users" mean? Not real important right now. Just brain storm about everything you envision the app doing for you. Go crazy with your thoughts, and we can dial it back later.  I'll go over them with you to help organize and clarify.

### Deliverables

- Create a folder in your assignments folder called `A05`
- Create a README.md outlining the requirements of your proposed project and place it in this folder.
- Upload to github. 
- Meet with me to discuss your project.
